2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and a detailed README.

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Added chat API support
   - Added model management endpoints (info, delete)
   - Added health check endpoints
   - Added CORS middleware
   - Added request timing middleware
   - Added global exception handling

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling with proper HTTP exceptions and consistent error responses.

5. **Configuration Management**: Added a configuration system with environment variable support.

6. **Code Reusability**: Created a service layer for Ollama API interactions to avoid code duplication.

7. **Type Safety**: Added proper type hints and Pydantic models for request/response validation.

8. **API Documentation**: Enhanced API documentation with descriptions, response models, and examples.

This improved version provides a more robust, maintainable, and feature-rich wrapper for the Ollama API while maintaining compatibility with the original functionality.
